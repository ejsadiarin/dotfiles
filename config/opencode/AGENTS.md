# Global Instructions

Personal preferences and workflow instructions that apply to all OpenCode sessions.

## Communication Style

- Be concise and direct in responses
- Avoid unnecessary preamble or filler text
- Skip obvious explanations unless asked
- Use technical terminology appropriate for experienced developers

## Workflow Preferences

- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Always verify file exists before attempting to edit
- When making changes, show only the relevant diff context
- Ask clarifying questions if requirements are ambiguous

## Code Changes

- Make minimal, focused changes that address the specific request
- Avoid refactoring unrelated code unless explicitly asked
- Preserve existing patterns and conventions in the codebase
- Test changes mentally before proposing them

## File Operations

- Check for existing similar files/patterns before creating new ones
- Respect .gitignore and don't modify ignored files unless asked
- Be cautious with destructive operations (delete, overwrite)
